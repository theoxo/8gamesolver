8-tile "sliding puzzle game" solver

What it does: Generates all reachable puzzle states from users first input, then looks for second input in those solutions. If found, prints out the path to reach that state (aka a solution to the puzzle).

Current status: Compiles, runs, horribly inefficient solutions and hour long load time.
